## Introduction

Cells (or transcripts) can be approximated as points given their location.

### `spatstat` package and `ppp` object

The central package to analyse point patterns in `R` is called `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('spatstat')` [@baddeleySpatstatPackageAnalyzing2005]. The main data object to compute on is called a `ppp` object. `ppp` objects describe point patterns in two dimensional space, `ppx` objects create multidimensional point patterns. A `ppp` object is is made up of three specifications [@baddeleySpatstatPackageAnalyzing2005]:

-   The locations of the points in question ($x$,$y$ and, optionally, $z$ coordinates)
-   The observation window
-   The associated marks to each point in the pattern

On this central object, various `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('spatstat')` metrics can be calculated.

### `SpatialExperiment` Object

![Structure of a `SpatialExperiment` object as introduced by Righelli et al.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drighelli/SpatialExperiment/devel/vignettes/SPE.png)

Often, the starting point in spatial omics data analysis is a `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('SpatialExperiment')` (or similar) object. This is a central data structure in the `BioConductor` framework to store spatial omics data. The data we consider here is a MERFISH assay of a mouse preoptic hypothalamus [@chenSpatiallyResolvedHighly2015; @moffittMolecularSpatialFunctional2018].

```{r}
#| label: load packages

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(SpatialExperiment)
  library(spatstat.geom)
  library(spatstat.explore)
  library(dplyr)
  library(ggplot2)
  library(patchwork)
  library(reshape2)
  library(stringr)
  library(tidyr)
  library(magrittr)
})
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: load-data
# load the data from ExperimentHub
source("code/load_data.R")
# source some helper functions
source("code/utils.R")
theme_set(theme_light())
# load the SpatialExperiment object
spe <- readRDS("data/spe.rds")
spe
```

We see that we have an object of class `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('SpatialExperiment')` with $161$ genes (rows) and $73655$ cells. This object is very similar to a `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('SingleCellExperiment')` object except it has the added `spatialCoords` slot. One slot in the `colData` is called `sample_id` which defines the so called z-slices. The three dimensional tissue is cut in the z-axis into consecutive two dimensional slices [@righelliSpatialExperimentInfrastructureSpatiallyresolved2022].

Next, we want to extract three slices of this `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('SpatialExperiment')` object and convert the 2D slices into `ppp` objects.

```{r}
# define the Z-stacks that you want to compare
zstack_list <- list("-0.09", "0.01", "0.21")
# small helper function to extract the z-slices and convert them to `ppp` objects
selectZstacks <- function(zstack, spe) {
  spe[, spe$sample_id == zstack] |> 
    .ppp(marks = "cluster_id")
}
pp_ls <- lapply(zstack_list, selectZstacks, spe) |>
  setNames(zstack_list)

pp_ls
```

We see that we obtain a list of three `ppp` objects for the three z-slices $-0.09, 0.01, 0.21$.

We can plot one of these slices, e.g. slice $-0.09$ with ggplot

```{r}
# create a dataframe from the point pattern
pp_df <- pp_ls$`-0.09` %>% as.data.frame
# plot with ggplot
ggplot(pp_df, aes(x, y, colour = marks)) +
  geom_point(size = 1) +
  coord_equal()
```

### Windows

As stated above, one important aspect of a point pattern is the observation window. It represents the region in which a pattern is observed or e.g. a survey was conducted [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 85]. In most microscopy use cases we encounter window sampling. Window sampling describes the case where we don't observe the entire point pattern in a window but just a sample [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 143-145].

The window of a point pattern does not need to be rectangular; we can receive round biopsies or calculate convex hulls around our sample [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 143-145].

Let's investigate the observation window for the slice $-0.09$.

```{r}
# subset point pattern list
pp_sub <- pp_ls$`-0.09`
# base R plot of all marks
pp_sub |> plot()
```

Here, we have a rectangular window around all points.

Let's investigate what a round window would look like:

```{r}
pp_sub_round <- pp_sub
# calculate circle with radius 850 Âµm and a center at the centroid of the window would look like
w <- disc(r = 850, centroid.owin(Window(pp_sub)))
Window(pp_sub_round) <- w
pp_sub_round |> plot()
```

Correctly assigning windows is very important. The window should represent the space where points are expected. This means, in window sampling, one should not restrict the window. This would lead to a false underestimation of the area where the points can be potentially observed. This problem of where we can observe points and where not (beyond the boundary of the window) leads to a range of problems collectively called edge effects [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 143-145]. We will discuss these later.

### Marks

The next concept that defines a point pattern is that marks can be associated with the points. The points can also have no mark, which we would call an unmarked point pattern

```{r}
unmark(pp_sub) |> plot()
```

Marks can be univariate or multivariate variables that are associated with the points [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 147]. In the context of cell biology we can distinguish between discrete marks (e.g. cell types) or continuous marks (e.g. gene expression).

#### Discrete Marks

In our example, we have a multitype point pattern, meaning there are different cell types that serve as marks for the point pattern. Multitype means that we consider all marks together. The opposite is multivariate, where we consider the marks independently [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 564 ff.].

First the multitype case:

```{r}
pp_sub |> plot()
```

Then splitting the point pattern and plotting a multivariate view on the same pattern.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=10}
pp_sub |>
  split() |>
  plot()
```

#### Continuous Marks

Marks can as well be continuous as in the case of gene expression. We choose some genes from the original paper and look at their distribution [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015 pp. 637; @moffittMolecularSpatialFunctional2018].

```{r}
# subset the original SpatialExperiment to our example slide -0.09
sub <- spe[, spe$sample_id == "-0.09"]
#  Genes from Fig. 6 of Moffitt et al. (2018)
genes <- c("Slc18a2", "Esr1", "Pgr")
gex <- assay(sub)[genes, ] %>%
  t() %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  set_rownames(NULL)
# gene expression to marks
marks(pp_sub) <- gex
```

Now that we have points with multivariate continuous marks

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# create a dataframe in long format for plotting
pp_df <- pp_sub %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:5)

ggplot(pp_df, aes(x, y, colour = log(value + 1))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~name) +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis")
```

We note that the expression of the genes `Pgr` and `Slc18a2` is very evenly distributed with some elevations in the middle of the structure. `Esr1` shows a half-circle like structure in expression. Note that the expression is here log transformed counts offset by one (to avoid problems with log of zero).

#### Within Mark Comparison

We can compare patterns between marks of the same type. This is referred to as a within mark comparison in our vignette. We can compare discrete marks, so the distribution of one single mark, e.g. a cell type.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# create a dataframe from the point pattern
pp_df_discrete <- lapply(zstack_list, function(x) {
  df <- pp_ls[[x]] %>% as.data.frame()
  df$stack <- x
  return(df)
}) %>% bind_rows()

# select OD Mature cells
pp_df_odmature <- pp_df_discrete[pp_df_discrete$marks == "OD Mature", ]

ggplot(pp_df_odmature, aes(x, y, colour = marks)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~stack, scales = "free") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

Here, we plot the distribution of mature oligodendrocytes across three slices of one 3D brain sample.

Continuous marks can be compared as well, e.g. the expression of a gene across slices of a tissue

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
pp_df <- lapply(zstack_list, function(x) {
  # subset the original SpatialExperiment to our example slide -0.09
  sub <- spe[, spe$sample_id == x]
  #  Genes from Fig. 6 of Moffitt et al. (2018)
  genes <- c("Slc18a2", "Esr1", "Pgr")
  gex <- assay(sub)[genes, ] %>%
    t() %>%
    as.matrix() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    set_rownames(NULL)
  # gene expression to marks
  marks(pp_ls[[x]]) <- gex
  df <- pp_ls[[x]] %>% as.data.frame()
  df$stack <- x
  return(df)
}) %>% bind_rows()

ggplot(pp_df, aes(x, y, colour = log(Esr1 + 1))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~stack, scales = "free") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis")
```

We note that the gene `Esr1` is differentially distributed across the slices of the 3D sample.

#### Correlation

Correlation is a second order quantity that measures the dependence between points [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015 pp. 199]. A famous way to measure this is with Ripley's $K$, which is a cumulative function that quantifies the "number of $r$-neighbours of a typical random point" [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 204; @ripleySecondOrderAnalysisStationary1976a].

##### Global Measures

Global correlation measures quantify the correlation in the entire window. Global Ripley's $K$ is defined as:

$$
\hat{K}(r) = \frac{|W|}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1 \\j \neq i}^n\{d_{ij}\leq r\} e_{ij}(r)
$$

In the formula above we note a few things:

-   The function is normalised by the number of points $n$ and the window size $|W|$

-   the term $e_{ij}(r)$ is an edge correction - see the section on `border corrections` further down in the vignette [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 204].

Ripley's $K$ function can be variance stabilised, which is referred to as Besag's $L$ [@caneteSpicyRSpatialAnalysis2022; @besag1977contribution]. The idea behind variance stabilisation is to "uncouple" the relationship between mean and variance. By taking the square root of the function in question, the variance is nearly constant across the function [@bartlettUseTransformations1947].

$$
L(r) = \sqrt{\frac{K(r)}{\pi}}
$$

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hide'}
res1 <- calcMetric("Kest", pp_ls, zstack_list, "OD Mature")

p <- ggplot(res1, aes(r, iso, colour = stack)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = r, y = theo), linetype = "dashed", color = "black")

res2 <- calcMetric("Lest", pp_ls, zstack_list, "OD Mature")

q <- ggplot(res2, aes(r, iso, colour = stack)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = r, y = theo), linetype = "dashed", color = "black")
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
p | q
```

The strongest estimate of association between oligodendrocytes is found for the slices $0.01$. Slice $0.21$ does not show such a high degree of association at radii $\leq300$ as the other two slices. This means that the apparent clustering we see in the distribution of points is mainly due to an overall higher number of cells in slide $0.21$ and not a higher degree of association per se. The black line indicates the expected $K$ respectively $L$ function for a completely spatially random poisson process [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 132 ff.].

Your turn: Try to compare the arrangement of `Ependymal` cells across these three sections. You can choose any function you might find in the documentation of `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('spatstat.explore')`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
res <- calcMetric(...)
```

A similar analysis can be performed for continuous marks. As an exercise, try to calculated a mark weighted correlation function `markcorr`. You get more information on this function by typing `?markcorr`. The mark weighted correlation function is defined as:

$$
k_f(r) =  \frac{\mathbb{E}[f(m(u),m(v))|u,v \in X]}{\mathbb{E}[f(M,M')]}
$$

where the numerator is the conditional expectation of the marks at location $u,v$ separated by a radius $r$ and $f$ can be any function linking the two marks. The denominator is the expectation of two random marks $M,M'$ [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 603].

```{r}
genes <- c("Slc18a2", "Esr1", "Pgr")
# add the genes as marks to the point pattern
pp <- lapply(zstack_list, function(x) {
  pp <- pp_ls[[x]]
  # subset the original SpatialExperiment
  sub <- spe[, spe$sample_id == x]
  #  Genes from Fig. 6 of Moffitt et al. (2018)
  genes <- c("Slc18a2", "Esr1", "Pgr")
  gex <- assay(sub)[genes, ] %>%
    t() %>%
    as.matrix() %>%
    data.frame() %>%
    set_rownames(NULL)
  # gene expression to marks
  marks(pp) <- gex
  return(pp)
}) |> setNames(zstack_list)

# calculate the metric for example slide '-0.09'
res <- calcMetric("markcorr", pp, zstack_list, 
                  "Esr1", continuous = TRUE)
p <- ggplot(res, aes(r, iso, colour = stack)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = r, y = theo), 
            linetype = "dashed", color = "black")

p
```

We note that at very small radii the expression of the gene `Esr1` shows a high association with itself. Later on, the association is less pronounced than in the slices $-0.09$ and $0.01$.

##### Local Measures

Next to observation window metrics, we can calculate point level statistics as well. One such option is the local indicators of spatial association (LISA). This gives one curve per point in the field of view [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015 pp. 247-248].

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hide'}
pp <- subset(pp_ls[["0.01"]], marks %in% "OD Mature")
L_odmature_lisa <- localL(pp)

df <- as.data.frame(L_odmature_lisa)
dfm <- reshape2::melt(df, "r")

get_sel <- dfm %>%
  filter(r > 200.5630 & r < 201.4388, variable != "theo") %>%
  mutate(sel = value) %>%
  select(variable, sel)

dfm <- dfm %>% left_join(get_sel)

p <- ggplot(dfm, aes(x = r, y = value, group = variable, colour = sel)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  scale_color_continuous(type = "viridis") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 200) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle("LISA curves of slice 0.01")
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
p
```

These curves could be analysed using tools from functional data analysis such as functional PCA [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015 pp. 247-248; @ramsayPrincipalComponentsAnalysis2005].

### Cross Mark Comparison

The same analyses as above can be performed between two celltypes. The corresponding functions are called cross functions [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015 pp. 594 ff.]. As an exercise, try to implement (similar to the analyses above) a cross comparison between two cell types of interest. With the provided functions this is possible, just give a function you like as input and a vector with two cell types you wish to compare. You can look at functions in the documentation of `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('spatstat.explore')`. We provide an example below:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
# select OD Mature and Microglia cells
pp_df_odmature_microglia <- pp_df_discrete[pp_df_discrete$marks %in% c("OD Mature", "Microglia"), ]

ggplot(pp_df_odmature_microglia, aes(x, y, colour = marks)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~stack, scales = "free") +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hide'}
res <- calcMetric("Lcross", pp_ls, by = zstack_list, 
                  mark = c("OD Mature", "Microglia"), 
                  continuous = FALSE)

q <- ggplot(res, aes(r, iso, colour = stack)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = r, y = theo), linetype = "dashed", color = "black")
```

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
q
```

We note that there is not a very strong co-localisation indicated by the $L$ curves between mature oligodendrocytes and microglia cells. If we look at their spatial distribution that makes sense since microglia cells are distributed more or less homogeneously in the respective slices.

Your turn: try to compare the colocalisation of `OD Mature` and `Ependymal`cells. Again, the documentation of `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg('spatstat.explore')` will help you to find good cross functions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res <- calcMetric(...)
```

### Edge effects and their corrections for spatial metrics

Edge effects describe the phenomenon that not the entire point process is observed, but rather only the part within the window $W$. This means the value of various statistics could be biased along the edges [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 213].

There are many corrections for edge effects that are briefly listed here [@baddeleySpatialPointPatterns2015, pp. 214-219]:

Border correction:

-   In border correction the summation of data points is restricted to $x_i$ for which $b(x_i,r)$ is completely in the window $W$.

Isotropic correction:

-   We can regard edge effect as a sampling bias. Larger distances (e.g. close to the edges) are less likely to be observed. This can be corrected for.

Translation correction:

-   A stationary point process $X$ is invariant to translations. So the entire point process can be shifted by a vector $s$ to be at the position $X+s$.

## Summary and Considerations

-   Point patterns are realisations of a point process. In the analysis we make inferences about the point process.

-   A point process assumes stochasticity. Therefore, HTS-based approaches are not suitable for point pattern analysis.

-   There are global metrics for the comparison within a celltype or between celltypes.

-   There are corresponding metrics for single cells and their interactions.

-   Point pattern analysis allows for the analysis of continuous gene expression marks as well.
