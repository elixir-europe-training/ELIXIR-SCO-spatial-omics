## Overview
This course delves into the cutting-edge field of Spatial Omics, focusing on Spatially-Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology which provides unprecedented insights into the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues. The rapid and recent advances in SRT technology are transforming our understanding of biological systems, and this course is designed to equip researchers with the tools to harness the power of SRT, adding significant value to biological knowledge and opening new avenues for scientific discovery.

Participants will explore both imaging-based and sequencing-based SRT technologies, learning to navigate the entire workflow of SRT data analysis. The course covers essential topics such as pre-processing techniques for data cleaning, normalization, and quality control, methods for identifying and characterizing spatial domains within tissues, strategies for integrating SRT data with single-cell RNA sequencing data, and statistical approaches to analyze spatial patterns and relationships. Additionally, participants will investigate interactions between cells within their spatial context. By the end of this course, participants will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to construct a complete workflow for SRT data analysis, from raw data to meaningful biological insights. The course combines lectures with practical sessions, ensuring a balanced approach to theory and hands-on experience. 

## Venue and time

This course will take place in Lausanne. The course will start the first day at 13:00. Find a detailed schedule [here](schedule.qmd). 

A lunch will be provided before the start of the course as well as at the end of the course on the last day. All participants are invited to the social dinner, organized on 21 January 2024. 

## Audience
This 3-day course is addressed to PhD students, postdocs, and researchers who are involved (or will be in the near future) in projects including spatially-resolved transcriptomics data, and want to acquire the skills to get started with spatial data analysis. 

## Learning outcomes 
At the end of the course, the participants will be able to:

* Identify and recall key concepts and terminology related to imaging- and sequencing-based SRT technologies. 
* Assess and evaluate quality of SRT data.
* Perform standard SRT data analysis, including data cleaning, normalization, quality control.
* Examine and interpret spatial patterns and relationships within SRT data using statistical and machine learning approaches.
* Construct a comprehensive workflow for SRT data analysis, from raw data to meaningful biological insights.

## Prerequisites

### Knowledge / competencies

Participants should be proficient in Python and R, for basic data analysis. 

Participants should be familiar with NGS technologies, have experience with analyzing (spatial/single-cell) transcriptomics data as well as basic knowledge of machine learning.

Participants should also have a basic understanding of working with command line tools on Unix-based systems. You can test your skills with Unix with the quiz <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. If you do not feel comfortable with UNIX commands, please take our <a href="https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html" target="”_blank”">Unix fundamentals</a> e-learning module.


### Technical
Participants are required to bring your own laptop. 

We will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a ‘normal’ remote server, and can be approached through a web browser (safari, firefox, chrome etc.). All participants will be granted access to a personal workspace to be used during the course. The web interface will be approached through http (not https!), so make sure you can access http sites. You can validate it [here](http://neverssl.com/).

Please perform these installations PRIOR to the course and contact us if you have any trouble.
