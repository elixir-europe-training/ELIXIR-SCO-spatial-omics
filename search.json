Then, use the password associated with your name to log in.\nNow you are in your personal container image. This image has two important directories that are mounted to all container images that are avaiable to you:\n\n(for jupyter-based practicals)/home/jovyan/workdir: a directory in home for which you have read and write access. This is where you will be mainly working in. For the rstudio-based practical this is /home/rstudio.\n/data: a directory where you only have read access. From here you can read the available input data.\n\nAt the first login, open a terminal, navigate to /home/jovyan/workdir and clone the repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-SCO-spatial-omics.git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFor jupyter containers, only /home/jovyan/workdir is shared with other containers. This means that everything you write outside this directory will not be available for other practicals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are comfortable with using git, you migh want to fork the repository first, and push your changes to your own namespace. In order to do so:\n\nFork the repository (Click ‘fork’ on the top right).\nSet your name and e-mail with:\n\ngit config --local user.email \"you@example.com\"\ngit config --local user.name \"Your Name\" \n\nClone the repository from your namespace to /home/jovyan/workdir\nMake changes and push them. You will be asked for your github username and password (use a token: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). If you are using a token, store it somewhere, because you have to login again if you move to a container of another practical.\n\n\n\nAfter cloning you can use the navigation menu to open a notebook. With each notebook, use the associated environment (has the same name as the notebook). Do this by clicking the button ‘Python 3 (ipykernel)’ on the top right of your notebook:\n\nAnd select the environment with the corresponding name from the dropdown menu. This ensures that you are using the correct dependencies for each practical.\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions, please ask one of the instructors for assistance. Happy coding!"

Use the token that is provided in the terminal to login. Change the option -v to mount another local directory to the container, for example the directory in which you have stored the required input files.\nFor the rstudio image of practical 5, this would be:\ndocker run \\\n--rm \\\n-p 8787:8787 \\\n-v $PWD:/home/rstudio \\\nsibswiss/elixir-sco-spatial-omics:practical_5\nNow Rstudio is available from localhost:8787.

    "text": "Overview\nThis course delves into the cutting-edge field of Spatial Omics, focusing on Spatially-Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology which provides unprecedented insights into the spatial organization of gene expression within tissues. The rapid and recent advances in SRT technology are transforming our understanding of biological systems, and this course is designed to equip researchers with the tools to harness the power of SRT, adding significant value to biological knowledge and opening new avenues for scientific discovery.\nParticipants will explore both imaging-based and sequencing-based SRT technologies, learning to navigate the entire workflow of SRT data analysis. The course covers essential topics such as pre-processing techniques for data cleaning, normalization, and quality control, methods for identifying and characterizing spatial domains within tissues, strategies for integrating SRT data with single-cell RNA sequencing data, and statistical approaches to analyze spatial patterns and relationships. Additionally, participants will investigate interactions between cells within their spatial context. By the end of this course, participants will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to construct a complete workflow for SRT data analysis, from raw data to meaningful biological insights. The course combines lectures with practical sessions, ensuring a balanced approach to theory and hands-on experience."

If you do not feel comfortable with UNIX commands, please take our Unix fundamentals e-learning module.\n\n\nTechnical\nParticipants are required to bring your own laptop.\nWe will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a ‘normal’ remote server, and can be approached through a web browser (safari, firefox, chrome etc.). All participants will be granted access to a personal workspace to be used during the course. The web interface will be approached through http (not https!), so make sure you can access http sites. You can validate it here.\nPlease perform these installations PRIOR to the course and contact us if you have any trouble."
